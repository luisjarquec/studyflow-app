# StudyFlow

A lightweight, open-source task and project management tool designed specifically for university students and academic teams.

## Overview

University students often have to manage multiple courses, deadlines, and group projects without a tool designed for academic workflows. Existing platforms are either too generic, require paid features for automation, or aren't prepared for student needs.

**StudyFlow** aims to fill that gap by providing an intuitive, customizable, and self-hosted task management solution built for students, by students.

## Features

With StudyFlow, you can:

- **📋 Kanban Boards** — Visualize your workflow with customizable columns for each course
- **🔔 Smart Reminders** — Never miss a deadline with customizable notifications
- **📊 Progress Tracking** — View analytics on your study habits and time spent
- **📁 Resource Management** — Attach lecture notes, PDFs, and links directly to tasks
- **👥 Collaboration** — Work on group projects with shared boards and real-time updates
- **🌙 Dark Mode** — Easy on the eyes for late-night study sessions
- **🔒 Privacy First** — Self-host and keep your academic data private
