## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Bundler** (for managing Ruby gems)
- **Node.js** 16+ and **npm** (for future JavaScript development)
- **Git**
- **Text Editor/IDE** (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)

### Setting Up the Jekyll Website

The `website/` directory contains the Jekyll-based marketing site for StudyFlow.

   cd website
   ```

3. **Install Jekyll and dependencies**:
   ```bash
   gem install jekyll bundler
   bundle install
   ```

4. **Run the Jekyll development server**:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

5. **Access the website**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000`

### Setting Up the Application (Future Development)

### Building Documentation

To build the Sphinx documentation:

```bash
# On Windows
.\make html

# On Unix/Mac
make html
```

For additional setup details or troubleshooting, refer to the main [README.md](README.md).

## Coding Style Guidelines

We use the following tools to maintain code quality:

- **ESLint**: Linting JavaScript/TypeScript code
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- **Prettier**: Code formatting
  ```bash
  npm run format
  ```

- **General guidelines**:
  - Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
  - Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
  - Add comments for complex logic
  - Follow the existing code style in the repository
  - Ensure your code passes all linting checks before submitting a PR

Before pushing your changes, run: `npm run lint && npm run format`

## Testing Guidelines

All contributions should include tests when applicable. We use Jest for testing:

- **Run all tests**:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

- **Run tests in watch mode**:
  ```bash
  npm test -- --watch
  ```

- **Run tests with coverage**:
  ```bash
  npm test -- --coverage
  ```

- **Writing tests**:
  - Place test files in the same directory as the code being tested with a `.test.js` or `.test.ts` suffix
  - Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
  - Aim for meaningful test coverage, especially for critical features
  - Test both happy paths and edge cases

Ensure all tests pass before submitting your pull request.

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the Conventional Commits specification. Please use the following format for your commit messages:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Type examples:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.
**Scope examples:** `website`, `docs`, `ui`, `config`, `build`, `deps`.
