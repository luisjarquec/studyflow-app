About the Project
=================

StudyFlow is a lightweight, open-source task and project management tool designed specifically 
for university students and academic teams.

The Problem
-----------

University students often have to manage multiple courses, deadlines, and group projects without 
a tool designed for academic workflows. Existing platforms are either too generic, require paid 
features for automation, or aren't prepared for student needs.

The Solution
------------

StudyFlow aims to fill that gap by providing an intuitive, customizable, and self-hosted task 
management solution built for students, by students.

Key Features
------------
